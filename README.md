My poetry script generates random words from the novel <i>A Christmas Carol</i>.
It is structured to form a poem one word at a time per line, but it sometimes it generates lines that have two or three words.
The idea behind this poem is to dissect obscure words and form them into something new while reading it vertically.
The script also randomly generates different patterns each time, so I saved a few stanzas that I thought were interesting such as:
<p>scrooge
<p>me
<p>dear brother
<p>was scrooge
<p>the ghost</p>
