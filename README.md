My poetry script generates random words from the novel <i>A Christmas Carol</i>.
It is structured to form a poem one word at a time per line, but it sometimes it generates lines that have two or three words.
The idea behind this poem is to dissect obscure words and form them into something new while reading it vertically.
The script also randomly generates different patterns each time, so I saved a few stanzas that I thought were interesting such as these two stanzas:
<p>scrooge
<p>me
<p>dear brother
<p>was scrooge
<p>the ghost</p>
<hr>
<p>scrooge
<p>sought
<p>livid color
<p>a
<p>weak
<p>dutch
<p>shadow
<p>addressed
<p>his
<p>mortal life</p>

I am proud with how this script came out.
When I saw the results of this poem, it ended up being more humorous than anticipated.
At some points of this poem, depending on the text it generates, it means that it is getting us ready for the holiday season in an obscure way by parodizing the classic Charles Dickens novel.
